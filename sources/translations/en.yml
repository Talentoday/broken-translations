        them into personalized predictive insights on individuals and job fit.
        This data is collected from our assessments and crowdsourcing on our website.
        Both individuals and organizations contribute to these efforts, continuously
        enriching solutions and making them smarter."
      sentence_2:

        technology enables this process and gives practical future insights about
        candidates. The algorithms determine the behavioral invariants of a successful
        and fulfilled population in an automated way, defining a Target Profile for
        a dedicated position, team, business unit, etc. You can then screen a pool of
        candidates in just one click, revealing the individuals that match those behavioral
        criteria and help you predict how a candidate will fit in at the company."

        algorithms to better define the psychology of a group of individuals, thanks to
        Talentoday's data. This supervised approach to machine learning, when conducted
        with accurate and reliable data, allows us to precisely differentiate the point
        clouds describing people's soft skills (human skills). When put into perspective

        characteristics that define that group."

        "The area under the ROC curve represents the ability of our algorithm to
        distinguish between individuals who do or do not belong to a specific group.
        An area of 50 means that our algorithm will not predict any better than at
        random. On the other hand, an area of 100 means a perfect prediction: no
        false positives (what seems to be positive, but is in fact negative) and
        no false negatives (what seems to be negative, but is in fact positive).
        The area under the ROC curve can never be less than 50."

      sentence_5:
        "The graph below corresponds to an algorithm with poor performance - it is
